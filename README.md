# ***Face Recognition Using Transfer Learning***

### This deep learning technique enables developers to harness a neural network used for one task and apply it to another domain.
### Take an example of an image recognition. Let’s say that you want to identify a particular face, but there aren’t any publicly available algorithms that do an adequate job. With the help of transfer learning, you begin with an existing convolutional neural network commonly used for recognition of other human beings, and you tweak it to train with dataset of the particular face you want.

### Below are some of the prediction made by this model having accuracy of 87%
